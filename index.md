**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
<br> The most interesting topic topic explored in this domain is the multitude of external factors influencing the stability of perovskite solar cells. Althugh PCE and efficiency due to certain stability environment is the ultimate metric that determines the succss, variable such as composition, passivator molecule, which describe the structure of the solar cell plays a significant role. Additionally, external factor such as humidity, temperature, and othe environmental condition further impact its performance.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For Quarter 2, I would like to investigate how different combinations of these variables can yield optimal perovskite performance. Since there are thousands of research papers published that discuss this task, literature mining could provide valuable insights into the relationships between these factors. By systematically analyzing existing studies, we aim to uncover patterns that inform the development of more efficient and stable solar cells.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I believe that extraction task can be investigated further. Currently, we are looking at LLM and complex system that performs extraction, but as we annotate these paper on teamtat, we realized that these task are more rigit and specific rather than the flexibility LLM offers. If the cost is something we can minimize, that is some approach we can take into consideration. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Looking further ahead, assuming the extraction process is successful and we build a comprehensive database summarizing the research I would be interested in using neural network to the project to predict the best perovskit composition to test for our project. Neural Network is essentially a blackbox, but I argue that this model can provide a vary complex analysis to predict the best perovskite composition for testing.
